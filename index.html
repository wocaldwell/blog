                <h2>‘Sandorkraut: A Pickle Maker’</h2>
                <p>Since the beginning of time, humans have been fermenting our food. Sauerkraut, chocolate, beer, cheese: Because of fermentation these foods not only last longer — they are delicious. But although nearly every region of the world has cultivated its own unique fermentation traditions — and devoted eaters — the practice has all but disappeared from many modern households. This Op-Doc video profiles the man at the forefront of reviving the art of fermentation, a New Yorker turned homesteader named Sandor Katz (or “Sandorkraut,” as he is often known).<br>After a health crisis in the 1990s, Mr. Katz gave up a career in politics to join an off-the-grid L.G.B.T. community in rural Tennessee. There, an overabundant cabbage harvest led him to make his first batch of sauerkraut, and sparked a fascination with fermentation. As his expertise has grown, Mr. Katz has become an apostolic hero to home cooks and celebrity chefs alike.<br>When Mr. Katz explores fermentation in his books, he goes beyond simple recipes. His accounts of making sauerkraut or tempeh become complex stories of radical food activism and self-sufficiency, musings on cultural anthropology and explorations of microbial science. But what captivated us most about Mr. Katz was his unique attitude toward his own mortality, and its intersection with the fermentation arts he practices. While empowering his followers to try their own hand at fermenting, he is not only reinvigorating an ancient cultural practice, but also reminding us what it means to be in a symbiotic relationship with microorganisms that have evolved alongside us throughout history.</p>

                <p>“The bicycle superseded by the automobile, the automobile compelling attention to the necessity for good roads, and with good roads throughout the country we may again see the bicycle coming into its own. Who will make the first move among the big manufacturers?”<br>—Louis M. Fisher, Former Secretary of the Associated Cycle Clubs of New York, in the New York Times on March 3, 1912<br>Dear Mr. Fisher,<br>Almost 97 years after you asked that question, I am pleased to report to you that the bicycle has indeed finally come into its own. And as for big manufacturers, the one responsible for this is, of course, the Great Trek Bicycle Making Company. Behold, the World's Greatest Madone:<br><img src="img/world's greatest trek.jpg"><br>It has rear-view mirrors to remind us from whence we came, and a rack to carry all that we've learned from history forward into the future. It also has a compact crank, Zipp 808 tubular wheels, and toe clips and straps. (Actually, scratch that--the rider has ditched the pesky straps.) It's steered by mountain bike bars with a gentle rise, and secured by a flimsy combination cable lock. I'm not sure what that piece of paper hanging of the bars is, but it's probably either a speech that will unify the entire cycling world in eternal siblinghood, or else the turn sheet for some charity ride.<br>My faith in cycling and humanity, considerably shaken after exploring the Times archives, has been restored.<br>Sincerely,<br>--BSNYC</p>

                <h2>What’s so unlucky about the number 13?</h2>
                <p>Researchers estimate that at least 10 percent of the U.S. population has a fear of the number 13, and each year the even more specific fear of Friday the 13, known as paraskevidekatriaphobia, results in financial losses in excess of $800 million annually, as people avoid marrying, traveling or in the most severe cases, even working. But what’s so unlucky about the number 13, and how did this numerical superstition get started?<br>An early myth surrounding the origin of the fear involved one of the world’s oldest legal documents, the Code of Hammurabi, which reportedly omitted a 13th law from its list of legal rules. In reality, the omission was no more than a clerical error made by one of the document’s earliest translators who failed to include a line of text—in fact, the code doesn’t numerically list its laws at all.<br>Mathematicians and scientists, meanwhile, point to preeminence of the number 12, often considered a “perfect” number, in the ancient world. The ancient Sumerians developed numeral system based on the use of 12 that is still used for measuring time today; most calendars have 12 months; a single day is comprised of two 12-hour half days, etc. Following so closely on the heels of a “perfect” number, some argue, the poor 13 was sure to be found lacking and unusual. This fear of the unknown would seem to play into two other popular theories for the number’s unlucky connotation, both of which revolve around the appearance of a 13th guest at two ancient events: In the Bible, Judas Iscariot, the 13th guest to arrive at the Last Supper, is the person who betrays Jesus. Meanwhile ancient Norse lore holds that evil and turmoil were first introduced in the world by the appearance of the treacherous and mischievous god Loki at a dinner party in Valhalla. He was the 13th guest, upsetting the balance of the 12 gods already in attendance.<br>It also seems as if unexplained fears surrounding the number 13 are a primarily Western construct. Some cultures, including the Ancient Egyptians, actually considered the number lucky, while others have simply swapped numbers as the base of their phobias—4 is avoided in much of Asia, for example. According to the Stress Management Center and Phobia Institute in Asheville, North Carolina, more than 80 percent of hi-rise buildings in the United States do not have a 13th floor, and the vast majority of hotels, hospitals and airports avoid using the number for rooms and gates as well. But in much of East and Southeast Asia, where tetraphobia is the norm, you’d be hard-pressed to find much use of the number 4 in private or public life, thanks to similar sounds for the Chinese language (and Chinese-influenced linguistic sub-groups) words for “four” and “death.”</p>
